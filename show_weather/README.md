# Show Weather

## Introduction

### Problem 
I have faced a problem with show weather utility on my linux distro and I did not solve it cuz I'm Lazy :)

### Solution
I found an easy way for doing that. It is just send GET request to http://wttr.in/ 
It is super duper easy than trying to see what is  the problem with linux utility, isn't it.
